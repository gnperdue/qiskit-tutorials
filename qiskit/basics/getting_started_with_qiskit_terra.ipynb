    "# Getting Started with Qiskit Terra\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we provide an overview of working with Qiskit Terra. Qiskit Terra provides the basic building blocks necessary to program quantum computers. The basic concept of Qiskit Terra is an array of quantum circuits. A workflow using Terra consists of two stages: Build and Execute. Build allows you to make different quantum circuits that represent the problem you are solving, and Execute allows you to run them on different backends.  After the jobs have been run, the data is collected. There are methods for putting this data together, depending on the program. This either gives you the answer you wanted, or allows you to make a better program for the next instance (e.g., when running the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm).\n",
